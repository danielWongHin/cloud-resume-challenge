# cloud-resume-challenge

This Project is going to demostrate a demo resume page hosting in Azure. In Azure, the serverless approach is decided to use by **Azure Function** and **CosmosDB**. Since the cost for the Azure entry-point service is pricier than I thought, we have decided to use **Cloudflare** as replacement.

## Future Work and Upcoming improvement 

The web page is a static website which ignored the React Framework from now. I have used Bootstrap for replacement in the project and blog rendering. But still figuring out how to do it on main page. 

Because of the complexity on Azure development, I might decide to migrate this challenge to AWS after the grading.
